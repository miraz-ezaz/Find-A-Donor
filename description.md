**App Title:** Find A Donor
---------------
Almost every day, posts or messages are seen on online media like Facebook or Messenger, where people are looking for blood for a patient. 
Thus looking for blood donors for the patient is time-consuming and costly.
So we wanted to create an app that would make it easy for a person to find and communicate with their nearest blood donor at any moment.

 **Project Functionalities**
 ------------
 We've added different functions to our app to make it easier for people to find blood.

**1. Authentication:** We added an authentication system so that there is no issue of spam.

**2. Direct Call:** Direct call system to donors for emergency situations.

**3. Location Share:** Donors and Recipients can share their location to find others and also reach the destination swiftly.
